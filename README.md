Welcome to My NBA Game Analysis

## Task
There were a lot of tests and I messed with them for a very long time.
One of them was to write a project only in python. 
Of course I could use pandas, however I have to increase my knowledge about python

## Description
The problems were difficult, so I worked for a long time.
But I solved these problems with the help of Google and friends

## Installation
You don't need to install anything. 
To run the code, you need to give the command in the terminal "python and file name"

## Usage
The principle of operation is simple, 
first it loads the data, then it turns the data into a dictionary, 
then it makes statistics, and finally it outputs statistics in the form of a table


./my_project argument1 argument2
```
